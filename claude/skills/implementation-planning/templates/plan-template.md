# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan

## Overview

[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]

## Current State Analysis

[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]

### Key Discoveries
- [Finding with `file:line` reference]
- [Pattern to follow]
- [Constraint to work within]

## Desired End State

[Specification of the end state and how to verify it]

## What We're NOT Doing

- [Explicit out-of-scope item]
- [Another boundary]
- [Prevents scope creep]

## Implementation Approach

[High-level strategy and reasoning]

## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]

### Overview
[What this phase accomplishes]

### Changes Required

#### [Component/File Group]
**File**: `path/to/file.ext`

**Changes**: [Summary]

```language
// Specific code to add/modify
```

### Success Criteria

#### Automated Verification
- [ ] Migration applies cleanly
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Type checking passes
- [ ] Linting passes

#### Manual Verification
- [ ] Feature works in UI
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Edge cases handled

**Note**: Pause for manual verification before proceeding to next phase.

## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]

### Overview
[What this phase accomplishes]

### Changes Required

#### [Component/File Group]
**File**: `path/to/file.ext`

**Changes**: [Summary]

```language
// Specific code to add/modify
```

### Success Criteria

#### Automated Verification
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Type checking passes

#### Manual Verification
- [ ] Feature works as expected
- [ ] No regressions

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [What to test]
- [Key edge cases]

### Integration Tests
- [End-to-end scenarios]

### Manual Testing
1. [Specific verification step]
2. [Another step]

## Performance Considerations

[Any performance implications]
