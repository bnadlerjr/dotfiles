# Product Brief Writing

Create vision documents that get everyone aligned on goals. A Product Brief unblocks discovery by giving a clear, intuitive idea of what we're trying to accomplish—before diving into requirements or solutions.

## When This Skill Applies

- Starting a new product or major initiative
- Articulating a problem statement or vision
- Creating a "one-pager" or "problem brief"
- User asks for "north star scenarios" or "product thesis"
- Need to align stakeholders before writing requirements
- Converting vague product ideas into clear direction

## Quick Start

Minimum viable path:

1. Ask the user about the problem, current state, and stakes.
2. Draft a thesis (specific, falsifiable claims) and an antithesis (honest risks).
3. Name 1-3 personas and define adoption, value, and business metrics with baselines and targets.
4. Write 3-5 north star scenarios in narrative form, including at least one failure or escalation case.
5. Review the brief for completeness and run a readability polish with the `writing-for-humans` skill. See Phase 5 in [workflow-phases.md](references/workflow-phases.md).
6. Present, iterate, and stop when the brief enables action.

Fall through to the detailed phases below for prompts, anti-patterns, and review checks.

## When Invoked

This skill is auto-loaded when its description matches the user's request, can be invoked directly via the Skill tool, or is triggered indirectly when the user runs the companion `/product-brief` slash command.

When the skill loads without an explicit topic, ask the user what product or initiative they want to define. Accept any of:

- A problem they're trying to solve
- A product idea to explore
- An existing initiative needing clarity

Then guide them through thesis, audience, metrics, and north star scenarios using the phases below.

## Core Principles

1. **Vision over Requirements**: Describe what success looks like, not how to build it
2. **Narrative over Lists**: Use stories (north star scenarios) to make goals intuitive
3. **Honest Assessment**: Include antithesis/risks—what could cause this to fail
4. **Outcome-Focused Metrics**: Track value delivered, not features shipped
5. **Focus over Breadth**: A complete brief is one that enables action, not one that covers everything

## Process Overview

┌───────────┐   ┌───────────┐   ┌───────────┐   ┌───────────┐   ┌───────────┐

└───────────┘   └───────────┘   └───────────┘   └───────────┘   └───────────┘
```

For detailed phase instructions, see [workflow-phases.md](references/workflow-phases.md). Phase 5 uses the `writing-for-humans` skill for the polish step. Several phases recommend named thinking patterns (atomic-thought, tree-of-thoughts, skeleton-of-thought, chain-of-thought, graph-of-thoughts, self-consistency); see the `thinking-patterns` skill for pattern details.

## Output Template

```markdown
# Product Brief for [Product Name]

[Brief vision statement—what this product will do and why it matters.]

## Product Thesis

We make [N] basic claims:

**[Claim 1 Title]**
[Explanation of claim and why it will work]

**[Claim 2 Title]**
[Explanation of second claim]

## Antithesis/Risks

What might cause this to not work as we expect?

- [Risk 1]
- [Risk 2]
- [Risk 3]

## Target Audience

We have [N] target personas:

**[Persona Name]**
[Description of persona, their situation, and primary goal]

**[Second Persona]**
[Description]

## Product Goals

[Summary of primary goals]

**Adoption metric**
[Specific metric with baseline → target]

**Value metric**
[Outcome metric with baseline → target]

**KPI**
[Business metric and expected direction]

## North Star Scenarios

**[Scenario 1 Title]**
[Narrative story with persona, situation, interaction, resolution, value capture]

**[Scenario 2 Title]**
[Second narrative story]

**[Scenario 3 Title]**
[Third narrative story, including at least one failure/escalation case]
```

## Example

For a complete example, see [kabletown-example.md](references/kabletown-example.md).

Key elements demonstrated:
- Two clear thesis claims (reduced frustration, lowered toil)
- Specific, falsifiable risks
- Named personas (Tinker Tia, Sad Lisa)
- Metrics with current baselines and targets
- Five scenarios covering happy paths, edge cases, and escalation

## Anti-Patterns

### Vague Thesis
```
Bad: "Our product will be better than competitors"
Bad: "Users will love it"

Good: "Users will resolve issues faster because the assistant
       understands intent better, getting handoff decisions right
       80% more often than the current system"
```

### Missing Antithesis
```
Bad: [No risks section]
Bad: "Minor risks: timeline might slip"

Good: "The assistant might take actions it shouldn't, causing users
       to be unpleasantly surprised—which would increase frustration
       instead of reducing it"
```

### Feature-as-Goal
```
Bad: "Launch feature X by Q2"
Bad: "Ship mobile app"

Good: "Increase fully automated support interactions from 15% to 65%"
```

### Scenario Without Value Capture
```
Bad: "User does the thing and it works. The end."

Good: "Once the technician reports install complete, Helpy checks
       back with her to do a survey."
```

### Implementation in Scenario
```
Bad: "She clicks the blue 'Help' button which opens a modal with
      a WebSocket connection to our support API..."

Good: "She sees the Helpy button and asks what's going on. Helpy
       checks her address against the outage map..."
```

## Tips for Better Briefs

- The brief is complete when it enables action, not when it's comprehensive
- Thesis claims should make you slightly nervous—if they're too safe, dig deeper
- Every scenario should reveal at least one requirement you hadn't explicitly listed
- If you can't demo a scenario, it's too abstract
- Revisit the brief when scenarios reveal gaps in thesis or metrics
