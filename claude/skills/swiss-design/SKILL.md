# Swiss Design for Software

**Core principle:** Clarity through reduction. Every element must earn its place. Remove until removing more would harm understanding.

The Swiss/International Typographic Style emerged in 1950s Switzerland as a reaction against decorative excess. Its principles—mathematical grids, typographic hierarchy, ruthless reduction—created a universal visual language that transcends culture and context.

These same principles apply directly to software and interaction design. A well-designed interface, like a well-designed poster, guides attention through structure rather than decoration.

## The Four Principles

1. **Reduction** — Strip to essentials. If it doesn't serve comprehension, it's noise. → [reduction.md]

2. **Grid** — Mathematical structure creates visual order that reduces cognitive load. → [grid.md]

3. **Hierarchy** — Control attention through contrast in size, weight, and position. → [hierarchy.md]

4. **Typography** — Type is the primary tool. It carries content and creates structure without ornament. → [typography.md]

## When This Skill Applies

- Generating UI components or layouts
- Creating documentation or technical prose
- Building data visualizations, tables, charts
- Designing CLI output or terminal interfaces
- Any output where a human needs to quickly comprehend information

## The Swiss Test

Before finalizing any design output, ask:

1. **Reduction:** Can I remove anything without losing meaning?
2. **Grid:** Does alignment create rhythm and relationships?
3. **Hierarchy:** Is there a clear reading order through size/weight/position?
4. **Typography:** Is type doing the structural work (not color or decoration)?

If any answer is "no," revise before shipping.

## Common Failures

**Decoration creep:** Adding visual elements "to make it look better" rather than to aid comprehension. Gradients, shadows, illustrations, icons—each must justify its presence.

**Hierarchy collapse:** When everything is bold, nothing is. When there are twelve font sizes, there's no system. Constraint creates clarity.

**Grid abandonment:** "Just this once" alignment exceptions accumulate into visual chaos. The grid is not a suggestion.

**Color as crutch:** Using color to create hierarchy that should exist in type. If the design doesn't work in grayscale, the structure is weak.

## Philosophy

Swiss design is not a style—it's a discipline. The goal isn't to "look Swiss." The goal is to remove everything that doesn't serve the reader's comprehension.

Müller-Brockmann: "The grid system is an aid, not a guarantee. It permits a number of possible uses and each designer can look for a solution appropriate to his personal style. But one must learn how to use the grid; it is an art that requires practice."

The same applies to all four principles. They are constraints that, properly applied, create freedom—freedom from arbitrary decisions, freedom from visual noise, freedom for the content to speak.
