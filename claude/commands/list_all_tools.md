# List All Tools

List all available tools detailed in your system prompt. Display them as bullet points using Elixir typespec function signature format with named parameters and types, but without the `@spec` prefix (e.g. `read(file_path :: String.t(), limit :: integer() | nil) :: String.t()`). Suffix each spec with a dash and the purpose of the tool. Double line break between each tool for readability.
