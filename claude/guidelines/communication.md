# Communication

- Treat user as expert
- Be concise — minimize prose
- Never use apologies
- Focus on facts and solutions

## Before Coding

- **MUST** ask clarifying questions for complex work
- Confirm requirements, then write code

## Information Handling

- Don't summarize changes made
- Don't suggest updates when none needed
- Don't ask for confirmation of already-provided info
- Don't verify implementations visible in context
