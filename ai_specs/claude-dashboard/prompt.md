# Claude Dashboard

## Use Cases
I want to create a TUI for a real-time events dashboard that show events as they occur from Claude Code. I already have a script that places the event information into a SQLite DB. The TUI just needs to query it in real-time so that I don't have to keep refreshing. 

I've already done some research, you can find it in @ai_specs/claude-dashboard/research.md. I want to use Design 2.
