# Use Cases: Claude Code Events TUI Dashboard

## Overview
This document defines comprehensive use cases for a Terminal User Interface (TUI) dashboard that monitors Claude Code events in real-time by querying a SQLite database. The implementation follows Design 2: Multi-Pane Analytics Dashboard from the research document.

## System Description
The Claude Code Events Dashboard is a real-time monitoring tool that provides developers with immediate visibility into Claude Code session activities, errors, and performance metrics through an efficient terminal interface.

### Key Components
- **Overview Panel**: Displays aggregate statistics (total events, success/error/warning counts, success percentage)
- **Event Stream Panel**: Shows real-time events with timestamp, ID, type, and status
- **Filters Panel**: Enables filtering by projects and event types
- **Details Section**: Provides in-depth information for selected events

## Use Cases

### UC-001: Monitor Real-time Events

**Goal in Context:** Developer monitors live Claude Code events to track current system activity and identify issues  
**Scope:** Claude Code Events Dashboard System  
**Level:** User Goal  

**Primary Actor:** Developer  
**Stakeholders and Interests:**
- Developer: Wants to see events as they happen, identify patterns, and catch errors quickly
- DevOps Team: Needs real-time visibility into system health and performance
- System: Must efficiently stream events without overwhelming the UI

**Preconditions:** 
- Dashboard is installed and running
- SQLite database is accessible and contains event data
- User has necessary permissions to view events

**Success Guarantee (Postconditions):** 
- User sees live events streaming in the Event Stream panel
- Overview statistics update in real-time
- All new events are displayed without missing any

**Minimal Guarantee:** 
- System continues to capture events even if display fails
- No data loss occurs

**Trigger:** User launches the TUI dashboard

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. User starts the TUI dashboard application
2. System connects to SQLite database and verifies access
3. System loads initial event data and statistics
4. System displays Overview panel with current totals and success percentage
5. System begins monitoring for new events
6. System displays new events in Event Stream panel as they arrive
7. System automatically scrolls to show latest events (if auto-follow enabled)
8. System updates Overview statistics with each new event
9. User monitors events until deciding to exit

**Extensions:**
- 2a. Database connection fails:
  - 2a1. System displays error message with connection details
  - 2a2. System offers retry option
  - 2a3. User fixes connection issue and retries
- 5a. No new events arrive for extended period:
  - 5a1. System continues monitoring without UI freezing
  - 5a2. System may display "No new events" indicator
- 7a. User disables auto-follow:
  - 7a1. System stops auto-scrolling
  - 7a2. User manually scrolls through events
- 9a. User presses 'q' to quit:
  - 9a1. System cleanly closes database connections
  - 9a2. System exits gracefully

**Technology & Data Variations:**
- Step 2: SQLite connection via local file or network
- Step 6: Events may arrive individually or in batches

**Special Requirements:**
- Events must appear within 100ms of database insertion
- UI must remain responsive with 1000+ events visible
- Memory usage should not grow unbounded with event count

**Frequency:** Continuous during development sessions  
**Open Issues:** Event retention policy for display buffer

### UC-002: Filter Events by Project and Type

**Goal in Context:** Developer filters event stream to focus on specific projects or event types

- Filters can be cleared to return to full view

**Trigger:** User navigates to Filters panel and selects filter options

**Main Success Scenario:**
1. User presses TAB or arrow key to navigate to Filters panel
2. System highlights Filters panel and shows available options
3. User selects one or more projects from project list
4. System immediately filters Event Stream to show only selected projects
5. User selects one or more event types (webhook, timer, api.call, etc.)
6. System applies combined filters (AND logic)
7. System updates Overview statistics to reflect filtered data
8. System indicates active filters in UI
9. User views filtered events

**Extensions:**
- 3a. No projects available in list:
  - 3a1. System displays "No projects found" message
  - 3a2. Use case ends
- 3b. User deselects all projects:
  - 3b1. System shows no events (empty filter result)
  - 3b2. System displays "No events match filters" message
- 6a. No events match combined filters:

  - 6a2. System shows informative message about filter results
- 9a. User clears all filters:
  - 9a1. System returns to showing all events
  - 9a2. Statistics update to show totals

**Technology & Data Variations:**
- Step 4: Filtering may be done in-memory or via database query
- Step 6: Filter logic could be AND or OR (currently AND)

**Special Requirements:**
- Filter application must complete within 50ms
- Filter state must persist during session
- Multi-select must be intuitive with keyboard navigation

```

### Database Schema Requirements

```sql
-- Expected events table structure
CREATE TABLE events (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL,
    type TEXT NOT NULL,
    project TEXT,
    status TEXT CHECK(status IN ('success', 'error', 'warning')),
    session_id TEXT,
    tool TEXT,
    prompt TEXT,
    input JSON,
    output JSON,
    duration_ms INTEGER,
    error_details TEXT
);

-- Required indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_events_timestamp ON events(timestamp DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_project ON events(project);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_type ON events(type);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_status ON events(status);
```

### Configuration Options

```python
# config.yaml example
database:
  path: "~/.claude/events.db"
  poll_interval_active: 1.0  # seconds
  poll_interval_idle: 5.0    # seconds

display:
  max_events_shown: 10000
  auto_follow: true
  show_timestamps: true
  time_format: "%H:%M:%S"
  
colors:
  success: "green"
  error: "red"
  warning: "yellow"
  info: "blue"

export:
  default_format: "json"
  default_directory: "~/claude-exports"
```

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Performance degradation with large datasets
**Mitigation**: Implement virtual scrolling, use database pagination, maintain ring buffer for display

### Risk 2: Database lock conflicts with writer process
**Mitigation**: Use read-only connection, implement retry logic with exponential backoff

### Risk 3: Terminal compatibility issues
**Mitigation**: Test on major terminals, provide fallback for advanced features

### Risk 4: Memory leaks in long-running sessions
**Mitigation**: Implement event cache limits, periodic garbage collection
