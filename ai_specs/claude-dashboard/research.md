# TUI Design Patterns for Real-Time Event Dashboards: A Comprehensive Guide

Modern Terminal User Interfaces (TUIs) have evolved significantly, offering sophisticated real-time capabilities that rival graphical interfaces while maintaining the efficiency and accessibility of terminal environments. This research provides a complete guide for designing a Claude Code events dashboard that queries SQLite in real-time.

## Modern TUI frameworks excel at real-time dashboards

The TUI ecosystem in 2023-2025 is dominated by five leading frameworks, each with distinct advantages. **Textual (Python)** leads with its CSS-like styling system and 16.7 million color support, making it ideal for rapid development. **Ratatui (Rust)** offers superior performance for high-frequency updates, while **Bubble Tea (Go)** provides an elegant Elm-inspired architecture. For SQLite integration specifically, all frameworks offer native support through their respective language ecosystems.

The choice of framework significantly impacts your dashboard's capabilities. Textual's async support and rich widget library make it particularly well-suited for real-time event monitoring, while Ratatui's immediate mode rendering ensures smooth updates even with thousands of events per second. The key is matching framework strengths to your specific performance requirements and development preferences.

## Design patterns optimize real-time data visualization

Successful real-time TUI dashboards employ three critical architectural patterns. First, **event-driven architectures** separate data collection from UI rendering, preventing blocking operations that could freeze the interface. Second, **selective rendering** updates only changed regions rather than redrawing the entire screen, dramatically improving performance. Third, **adaptive polling intervals** adjust refresh rates based on system activity - typically 1-2 seconds for critical metrics and 3-5 seconds for background data.

Modern frameworks implement these patterns through different mechanisms. Bubble Tea uses a message-based system where data updates trigger specific UI commands, while Ratatui leverages Rust's async runtime for concurrent data processing. The most effective approach combines push notifications for critical events with periodic polling for system metrics, ensuring both responsiveness and efficiency.

## Visual hierarchy and color schemes enhance usability

The most effective TUI designs leverage **semantic color coding** consistently: red for errors, yellow for warnings, green for success, and blue for informational content. This convention, established by tools like k9s and htop, provides immediate visual feedback about system state. Modern terminals' 24-bit color support enables sophisticated palettes beyond traditional 16-color limitations.

Layout strategies follow clear patterns. **Table-based layouts** excel for structured event data, using fixed-width columns with sortable headers. **Card layouts** group complex event details visually, while **multi-pane dashboards** separate concerns effectively. The key is maintaining **visual stability** - consistent column widths, fixed element positions, and smooth transitions prevent user disorientation during updates.

## Interaction patterns balance power and accessibility

Leading TUI applications implement a **tri-modal interaction system**: vim-style keyboard navigation for power users, intuitive arrow key movement for general users, and optional mouse support for precision selection. The most successful pattern is **incremental search with real-time filtering**, popularized by fzf, which updates results on every keystroke while highlighting matches.

For event logs specifically, **virtual scrolling** becomes essential when handling thousands of entries. This technique renders only visible items plus a small buffer, maintaining performance regardless of dataset size. Combined with **follow mode** (auto-scrolling to new events) and **smart filtering** (preserving context while narrowing results), users can efficiently navigate large event streams without losing their place.

## Three distinct dashboard designs for Claude Code events

### Design 1: Minimalist Stream View
```
┌─ Claude Code Events ─────────────────────── ◉ LIVE ─┐
│ 14:32:01 │ webhook.recv │ project-alpha │ ✓ success │
│ 14:31:45 │ timer.exec   │ project-beta  │ ⚠ warning │
│ 14:31:20 │ api.call     │ project-alpha │ ✗ error   │
│ 14:30:55 │ db.query     │ project-gamma │ ✓ success │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [F]ilter [S]earch [D]etails [R]efresh / to search  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
This design prioritizes **information density** with a clean, scannable format. Events stream in real-time with color-coded status indicators. The single-pane layout maximizes vertical space for event display while providing essential filtering controls at the bottom.

### Design 2: Multi-Pane Analytics Dashboard
```
┌─ Overview ──────────┬─ Event Stream ─────────────────┐
│ Total: 1,247       │ 14:32:01 evt_123 webhook       │
│ Success: 1,180     │   Input: {"user": "john"}      │
│ Errors: 42         │   Output: {"status": "ok"}     │
│ Warnings: 25       │ ─────────────────────────────── │
│                    │ 14:31:45 evt_122 timer         │
│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░ 95%    │   Project: beta                │
├─ Filters ──────────┤   Status: Warning              │
│ ☑ All Projects     ├────────────────────────────────┤
│ ☐ project-alpha    │ Session: sess_abc123           │
│ ☐ project-beta     │ Tool: curl                     │
│ ─────────────────  │ Prompt: "Deploy the app"       │
│ ☑ All Types        │                                │

│ ☐ timer            │ Duration: 1.2s                 │
└────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────┘
```
This design provides **comprehensive monitoring** with dedicated panels for statistics, filters, and detailed event information. The layout supports both high-level overview and deep-dive analysis, with interactive elements for real-time filtering.

### Design 3: Timeline-Based Event Viewer
```
┌─ Claude Code Events Timeline ───────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
This innovative design visualizes events as a **temporal heatmap**, showing activity patterns across projects over time. Dense blocks indicate high activity periods, enabling quick identification of anomalies or patterns.

## Implementation recommendations maximize effectiveness

Start with **Textual** for Python environments due to its rich widget library and excellent SQLite integration through async support. Use **adaptive polling** with 1-second intervals for active monitoring and 5-second intervals during idle periods. Implement **ring buffers** to limit memory usage while maintaining recent event history.

For optimal performance, employ **partial screen updates** for real-time data changes and **virtual scrolling** for datasets exceeding 10,000 events. Use **semantic color coding** consistently across all three designs, and implement **keyboard shortcuts** following vim conventions (j/k for navigation, / for search, q for quit).

The key to successful TUI event dashboards lies in balancing information density with visual clarity, providing powerful filtering capabilities while maintaining responsive performance, and offering intuitive navigation patterns that scale from dozens to millions of events.
