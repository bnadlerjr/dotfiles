## Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, idiomatic Elixir code with accurate examples.
- Follow Phoenix conventions and best practices.
- Use functional programming patterns and leverage immutability.
- Prefer higher-order functions and recursion over imperative loops.
- Use descriptive variable and function names (e.g., user_signed_in?, calculate_total).
- Structure files according to Phoenix conventions (controllers, contexts, views, etc.).
  
## Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for file names, function names, and variables.
- Use PascalCase for module names.
- Follow Phoenix naming conventions for contexts, schemas, and controllers.
  
## Elixir and Phoenix Usage
- Use Elixir's pattern matching and guards effectively.
- Leverage Phoenix's built-in functions and macros.
- Use Ecto effectively for database operations.
  
## Syntax and Formatting
- Follow the Elixir Style Guide (https://github.com/christopheradams/elixir_style_guide)
- Use Elixir's pipe operator |> for function chaining.
- Prefer single quotes for charlists and double quotes for strings.
  
## Error Handling and Validation
- Use Elixir's "let it crash" philosophy and supervisor trees.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly messages.
- Use Ecto changesets for data validation.
- Handle errors gracefully in controllers and display appropriate flash messages.
  
## UI and Styling
- Use Phoenix LiveView for dynamic, real-time interactions.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
- Use Phoenix view helpers and templates to keep views DRY.
  
## Performance Optimization
- Use database indexing effectively.
- Implement caching strategies (CachEx, ETS, Redis).
- Use Ecto's preload to avoid N+1 queries.
- Optimize database queries using preload, joins, or select.
  
## Key Conventions
- Follow RESTful routing conventions.
- Use contexts for organizing related functionality.
- Implement GenServers for stateful processes.
- Use Oban for background jobs.
- Use Tasks for concurrent, isolated jobs.
  
## Testing
- Write comprehensive tests using ExUnit.
- Follow TDD practices.
  
## Security
- Use strong parameters in controllers (params validation).
- Protect against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection).
  
Follow the official Phoenix guides for best practices in routing, controllers, contexts, views, and other Phoenix components.
